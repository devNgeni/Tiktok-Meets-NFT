## Tiktok Meets NFT

To create an App[OnceApp] that is combined with tik tok(that seek kind of imagery) and has overlaying with menus and smart features. 

The end user of the app should be able to capture moments and then turn the moments into NFTs which can then be traded by selling the moments yourself or buying. The project should be done using Flutter since it is both favourable for IOS and android users. 
The project will be done in a testflight testing environment. This would enable the client to download the app via the app store or a provided link.

The main aim of the project is to reform OpenSea market from imagery and put it in tik tok or instgram style feed whereby the NFTs will be presented as moments in someoneâ€™s life. 
The end user should be able to capture moments just like in tik tok or instagram. These moments will be video clips or images and they will be minted directly into the blockchain.
The project will be in collaboration with loom in order to ensure that everything in the app is free including Minting moments on NFT, sending the moments to another user and any other interaction of the app provided it stays in the loom network
